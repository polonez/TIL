Q: Are there two irrational numbers a, b which make a\*\*b rational number?
A: It can be proven by non-constructive method.

Let a, b be sqrt(2).

Assume that a\*\*b is a irrational number. \*

Let c be an irrational number, sqrt(2).

Then, (a\*\*b)\*\*c = (sqrt(2)\*\*sqrt(2))\*\*sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)\*\*(sqrt(2)\*sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2)\*\*2 = 2

Otherwise, a\*\*b is a rational number which proves the given statement.

\* In fact, it is an irrational.
